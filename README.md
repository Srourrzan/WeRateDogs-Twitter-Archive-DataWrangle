# WeRateDogs Twitter Archive DataWrangle

## Abstract

Using Twitter Archives for the WeRateDogs [twitter profile](https://twitter.com/dog_rates), I made Data Wranling  on the data then made some fun insights about their rated dogs.


## Introduction

Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, T had gathered data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assessed its quality and tidiness, then cleaned it. This is called data wrangling. Then documented my wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries).

The dataset that I had wrangled (and analyzed and visualized) is the tweet archive of Twitter user [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates), also known as [WeRateDogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeRateDogs). WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017. More on this soon.


## Project goal:

* wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. The Twitter archive is great, but it only contains very basic tweet information. Additional gathering, then assessing and cleaning is required.


* The ratings probably aren't all correct. Same goes for the dog names and probably dog stages.some assess and clean is needed for these columns to use them for analysis and visualization.

* **Additional Data via the Twitter API** Use Twitter's API to gather more informations about the data used in the project.


## Dogtionary from WeRateDogs book

The Dogtionary explains the various stages of dog: doggo, pupper, puppo, and floof(er) (It can be found in the files provided in the repo.).
